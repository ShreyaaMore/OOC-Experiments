---

### Experiment No. 2
Implement a program to create a Complex class to represent complex numbers. Implement member functions for addition, subtraction, and display of complex numbers.

---

### Experiment No. 3
Develop a simple banking system with classes for SavingAccount and CheckingAccount. Implement features such as deposit, withdrawal, and account statement.

---

### Experiment No. 4
Implement a Rectangle class with attributes for length and width. Include constructors, a destructor, and member functions to calculate the area and perimeter.

---

### Experiment No. 5
Implement a Program to find out area of different shapes using function overloading.

---

### Experiment No. 6
- A- Implement a program to create a Student class from which to derive StudentExam class and from StudentExam class derive Result class (Multilevel Inheritance). 
- B- Implement a class hierarchy for a simple library system with a base class LibraryItem and derived classes Book and Magazine (Hierarchical Inheritance).

---

### Experiment No. 7
- A- Implement a program to perform multiple inheritance for the Educational Institute database. 
- B- Implement a program to perform Hybrid Inheritance.

---

### Experiment No. 8
Implement a program to overload all unary, binary and relational operators.

---

### Experiment No. 9
Implement a program to overload insertion and extraction operators.

---

### Experiment No. 10
Implement a program to create a base class Shape with a virtual function area(). Derive two classes Circle and Rectangle from Shape and implement the area() function in each derived class.

---

### Experiment No. 11
Implement a program to create a base class Employee with a virtual function calculateSalary(). Derive two classes SalariedEmployee, HourlyEmployee and CommissionedEmployee and implement the calculateSalary() function in each derived class.

---

### Experiment No. 12
Implement a program to write user input data to a file and then read it back from the file.

---

### Experiment No. 13
Implement a program that uses try, catch, and throw to handle division by zero exceptions. Create a custom exception class InvalidAgeException and use it to validate the age input for a Person class.

---

### Experiment No. 14
Implement a program using a template function to find the maximum of two numbers. Create a program that demonstrates the use of STL containers (vector, list, map) for basic operations.

---

### Experiment No. 15
Mini-project using C++ programming for solving real time problems.
